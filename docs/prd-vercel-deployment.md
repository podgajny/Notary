# PRD: Vercel Deployment for Notary App

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the deployment of the Notary application to Vercel's free tier platform. The goal is to make the Vue 3 + Vite application publicly accessible on the internet with automatic deployments from the main branch and preview deployments for feature branches and pull requests.

The current application is a simple note display MVP built with Vue 3, Vite, and TailwindCSS that shows static content. This deployment will serve as the foundation for future backend integration and user management features.

## Goals

1. **Public Accessibility**: Make the Notary app accessible via a public URL on the internet
2. **Automated Deployments**: Set up automatic production deployments from the main branch
3. **Preview Deployments**: Enable preview deployments for all feature branches and pull requests
4. **Zero-Cost Hosting**: Utilize Vercel's free tier for hosting the static Vue application
5. **Future-Ready Setup**: Configure deployment pipeline to support future backend integration
6. **Minimal Maintenance**: Establish a deployment process that requires minimal ongoing maintenance

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want the app to automatically deploy to production when I merge code to the main branch, so that new features are immediately available to users.

2. **As a developer**, I want preview deployments for feature branches and PRs, so that I can test and share changes before merging to production.

3. **As an end user**, I want to access the Notary app via a stable public URL, so that I can view notes from any device with internet access.

4. **As a project stakeholder**, I want to be able to share the app URL with others for feedback and demonstration purposes.

5. **As a developer**, I want the deployment to handle future environment variables (VITE_*) properly, so that I can configure different settings for preview and production environments.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Vercel Project Setup**: The Notary app must be connected to a Vercel project with automatic Git integration.

2. **Build Configuration**: Vercel must successfully build the Vue 3 + Vite application using the existing `npm run build` command.

3. **Production Deployment**: 
   - Production deployments must trigger automatically when code is pushed to the main branch
   - Production deployment must be accessible via a stable Vercel-provided domain (e.g., `notary-xyz.vercel.app`)

4. **Preview Deployments**:
   - Preview deployments must be created for all feature branches
   - Preview deployments must be created for all pull requests
   - Each preview deployment must have a unique URL for testing

5. **Static Asset Serving**: All static assets (CSS, JS, images) must be served correctly from the Vercel CDN.

6. **Environment Variable Support**: The deployment must support VITE_* prefixed environment variables for future configuration needs.

7. **Build Process**: The deployment must use Node.js 20 (LTS) and npm as specified in the project requirements.

8. **Custom Domain Ready**: The setup must allow for easy custom domain configuration in the future.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Custom Domain Setup**: Initial deployment will use Vercel's auto-generated domain
2. **Advanced Monitoring**: No custom analytics or monitoring tools beyond Vercel's built-in features
3. **Backend Integration**: Current deployment is frontend-only; backend integration is a future enhancement
4. **User Authentication**: No authentication or user management in this deployment phase
5. **Database Setup**: No database configuration as the current app uses static data
6. **CDN Configuration**: Will use Vercel's default CDN settings
7. **SSL Certificate Management**: Vercel handles SSL automatically
8. **Performance Optimization**: Beyond Vite's default optimizations

## Design Considerations

1. **Vercel Configuration**: Create a `vercel.json` file if specific routing or build settings are needed
2. **Build Output**: Ensure the Vite build output (`dist/`) is correctly configured for Vercel's static hosting
3. **Asset Optimization**: Leverage Vite's built-in asset optimization and Vercel's CDN for optimal performance
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify that the TailwindCSS responsive design works correctly on the deployed version

## Technical Considerations

1. **Node.js Version**: Use Node.js 20 (LTS) as specified in project requirements
2. **Build Command**: Use the existing `npm run build` command which runs `vue-tsc && vite build`
3. **Output Directory**: Vite outputs to `dist/` directory by default, which Vercel will auto-detect
4. **Environment Variables**: Configure support for VITE_* environment variables in Vercel dashboard
5. **Git Integration**: Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments
6. **Branch Protection**: Ensure main branch deployments are prioritized for production

## Success Metrics

1. **Deployment Success**: Application successfully builds and deploys without errors
2. **Accessibility**: App is accessible via public URL within 5 minutes of deployment
3. **Build Time**: Build and deployment completes in under 3 minutes
4. **Automatic Deployment**: New commits to main branch trigger automatic production deployments within 2 minutes
5. **Preview Functionality**: Feature branches and PRs generate preview deployments with unique URLs
6. **Performance**: Page load time under 2 seconds on Vercel's CDN
7. **Uptime**: 99.9% uptime (Vercel's standard for free tier)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
1. Create Vercel account if not already available
2. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure project settings (Node.js 20, npm, build command)
4. Verify build process works correctly

### Phase 2: Deployment Configuration
1. Set up automatic deployments from main branch
2. Configure preview deployments for feature branches and PRs
3. Test deployment with current static content
4. Verify all routes and assets load correctly

### Phase 3: Verification & Documentation
1. Test production deployment functionality
2. Test preview deployment functionality
3. Document deployment URLs and access information
4. Create deployment troubleshooting guide

## Environment Variables Configuration

For future use, the following environment variable structure will be supported:

- **Production Environment**: Set VITE_* variables in Vercel's production environment settings
- **Preview Environment**: Set VITE_* variables in Vercel's preview environment settings
- **Example Variables**: 
  - `VITE_API_URL` for backend API endpoints
  - `VITE_APP_VERSION` for version display
  - `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` for environment identification

## Open Questions

1. Should we set up any basic error tracking or monitoring beyond Vercel's built-in analytics?
2. Do we want to configure any specific caching headers for static assets?
3. Should we set up any branch protection rules in GitHub to complement the Vercel deployment strategy?
4. Do we need any specific redirect rules for future routing requirements?

## Future Considerations

This deployment setup is designed to accommodate future enhancements:

1. **Backend Integration**: Easy addition of API routes and serverless functions
2. **Database Connection**: Environment variables ready for database URLs
3. **User Authentication**: Preview/production environment separation ready for auth services
4. **Custom Domain**: Simple migration path to custom domain when ready
5. **Advanced Features**: Foundation for note editing, user management, and filtering capabilities
