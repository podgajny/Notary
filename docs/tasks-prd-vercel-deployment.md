# Tasks: Vercel Deployment for Notary-web App

Based on PRD: `prd-vercel-deployment.md`

## Relevant Files

- `Notary-web/package.json` - Contains build scripts and dependencies for deployment configuration
- `Notary-web/vite.config.js` - Vite configuration that may need optimization for Vercel deployment
- `Notary-web/vercel.json` - Vercel-specific configuration file (to be created if needed)
- `Notary-web/.gitignore` - Ensure proper files are ignored for deployment
- `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Documentation for deployment process and troubleshooting (to be created)

### Notes

- Vercel automatically detects Vite projects and uses appropriate build settings
- The deployment process primarily involves configuration rather than code changes
- Focus on ensuring the existing Vue 3 + Vite app builds correctly on Vercel's platform
