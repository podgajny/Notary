# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Notary Vue** - a Vue 3 application built with Vite, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS following TDD principles. It's a simple note display application designed as a learning project for Test-Driven Development and CI/CD practices.

## Essential Commands

### Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Development server (port 5173)
npm run build        # Production build (includes TypeScript compilation)
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Testing & Quality Assurance

```bash
npm run test         # Unit tests in watch mode (Vitest)
npm run test:run     # Unit tests single run
npm run test:ui      # Unit tests with UI interface
npm run test:coverage # Unit tests with coverage report
npm run lint         # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint:fix     # Code formatting with Prettier
```

**Important**: Always run `npm run lint` and `npm run test:run` after making changes. These commands are enforced by CI/CD pipeline.

## Architecture & Code Structure

### Component Architecture

- **App.vue**: Root component that renders NoteDisplay
- **NoteDisplay.vue**: Main feature component displaying static note content
- Components follow Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- All styling uses TailwindCSS utility classes

### Test Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Located in `__tests__/` directories alongside components
- **Test naming**: Use Polish descriptions starting with "powinien" (should)
- **Snapshot tests**: Included to track component structure changes
- **TDD approach**: Write failing tests first, then implement features

### TypeScript Configuration

- Strict mode enabled with `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- Vue 3 specific configuration with JSX preserve mode

### Styling System (from .cursorrules)

- **Primary**: TailwindCSS for all styling
- **Component library**: shadcn-vue components (when added)
- **Naming**: UI components have `Ui` prefix (UiButton, UiCard)
- **Class ordering**: Enforced by prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with max 2 breakpoints per component
- **Limits**: Max 10 classes per element, max 3 nesting levels

### Build & Deployment

- **Build tool**: Vite with Vue plugin
- **Deployment**: Automated via Vercel on main branch
- **Bundle size limit**: 2MB (enforced by CI)
- **Node version**: 20.x LTS

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Checks (on PR)

1. TypeScript type checking (`npm run lint`)
2. Unit tests execution (`npm run test:run`)
3. Build verification (`npm run build`)
4. Bundle size validation (<2MB)
5. Merge conflict detection

### Git Hooks (Husky)

- **Pre-commit**: Prettier formatting via lint-staged
- **Files processed**: `*.{vue,ts,js,json,md}`

### Branch Protection

- Main branch requires PR approval
- All CI checks must pass before merge
- Up-to-date branch requirement enforced

## Development Workflow

### TDD Cycle

1. **RED**: Write failing test in `__tests__/` directory
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass the test
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Component Development

- Create component in appropriate directory under `src/components/`
- Write tests first following TDD principles
- Use existing patterns from NoteDisplay.vue as reference
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`

### Code Quality Standards

- Comments in Polish (as per .cursorrules)
- No arbitrary Tailwind values without TODO justification
- Extract repeated class combinations into components or @apply
- Maintain accessibility with focus-visible states and aria attributes

## Environment Setup

- **Node.js**: 20.x LTS required
- **Package manager**: npm (lock file committed)
- **Development port**: 5173 (Vite default)
